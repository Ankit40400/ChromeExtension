This is the Simple basic project. Which I created to learn javascript language.
This is the Leads Tracker Chrome Extension where User can save the current tab, save any input if user want to and then delete all the saved records. 
if user wants, I have created this project with the help of Per Harald Borgen video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS4aFq5-91M&t=19554s)
